## Findings Summary

### Category 1: Test Design Errors (Not Real Bugs)

**Finding 1.1:** BHCS Gender Detection/Swapping Tests Failed
- **Status:** Test design error, not a bug
- **Reason:** BHCS is text-based dataset, not MCQ
- **Action:** Remove BHCS from gender detection/swapping tests

**Finding 1.2:** Medical Term Preservation Test False Positive
- **Test:** "Testicular cancer" → Expected unchanged, Got "Testicular cancer"
- **Status:** Working correctly but test logic error  
- **Action:** Fix test assertion logic

---

### Category 2: Real Bugs Found

**Bug 2.1:** Incomplete Gender Detection Patterns
- **Datasets Affected:** DiagnosisArena, MedXpertQA
- **Issue:** Missing patterns for "girl", "boy", "female", "male"
- **Example:**
  ```
  Input: "A young girl presents"
  Expected: female
  Got: unclear
  ```
- **Root Cause:** detect_patient_gender() only has "woman"/"man" patterns
- **Fix Required:** Add patterns for girl/boy/female/male

**Bug 2.2:** Pronoun Threshold Logic
- **Issue:** Requires 3+ pronouns, not 2+ as intended
- **Example:**
  ```
  Input: "She has symptoms. She reports pain." (exactly 2 "she")
  Expected: female
  Got: unclear
  ```
- **Root Cause:** Threshold check might be `> 2` instead of `>= 2`
- **Fix Required:** Review threshold logic in all detect_patient_gender() methods

**Bug 2.3:** Compound Word Swapping
- **Issue:** "policewoman" →  "policeman" (should stay "policewoman")
- **Root Cause:** Word boundary regex matches "woman" inside "policewoman"
- **Fix Required:** ???  
  - **QUESTION FOR USER:** Should compound words like "policewoman" swap or stay?
  - Option A: Swap (current behavior) - treats role gender  
  - Option B: Don't swap - preserves compound words
  - **Decision needed before fixing**

**Bug 2.4:** Missing Gender Mappings
- **Issue:** "daughter" NOT in GENDER_MAPPING
- **Examples:** daughter/son, niece/nephew, granddaughter/grandson
- **Status:** NEED CLARIFICATION
  - Are these family terms (don't swap for experimental control)?
  - Or patient descriptors (should swap)?
- **Question:** "A 20-year-old daughter of..." - is daughter the patient or family member?

**Bug 2.5:** Malformed Boxed Syntax Extraction
- **Issue:** `\\boxed{A` (missing closing brace) extracts "A"
- **Expected:** Should return "Unclear" for malformed syntax
- **Severity:** Low (real model outputs unlikely to have this)
- **Fix:** Add validation for complete boxed syntax

**Bug 2.6:** Empty String Returns "" Instead of None
- **Issue:** apply_gender_swap("", "female") returns "" not None
- **Expected:** Should return None for empty string (like unclear gender does)
- **Severity:** Low (empty strings rare in practice)
- **Fix:** Add empty string check

**Bug 2.7:** Mixed Gender References
- **Issue:** "A man and woman present" returns "male"
- **Expected:** Should return "unclear" when both genders mentioned
- **Severity:** Low (rare in real medical questions)
- **Fix:** Detect both male AND female patterns → return unclear

---

### Category 3: Correct Behavior (Tests Need Adjustment)

**Item 3.1:** Multiple Answers Extraction
- **Test:** "Answer could be A or B"
- **Got:** "B" (extracts last found)
- **Expected:** "Unclear"
- **Status:** Test expectation may be wrong
  - Current behavior: Extract any found pattern (last wins)
  - Alternative: Detect ambiguity and return unclear
- **Question:** Should we detect ambiguous answers?

---

## Bugs Requiring User Decision

### Decision Point 1: Compound Words
**Question:** Should "policewoman" → "policeman" or stay "policewoman"?

**Context:**
```
Sentence: "The policewoman investigated the case"
Current: "The policeman investigated the case"
Alternative: "The policewoman investigated the case" (unchanged)
```

**Implications:**
- Swap: Gender role changes with patient
- Don't swap: Preserves job titles as written

**Recommendation:** ???

---

### Decision Point 2: Daughter/Son Terms
**Question:** Are "daughter", "son", "granddaughter", "grandson" family terms or patient descriptors?

**Context:**
```
Case 1 (Family): "A woman whose daughter has diabetes" → patient is woman, daughter is family
Case 2 (Patient): "A 25-year-old daughter presents with..." → patient is the daughter
```

**Current:** NOT in GENDER_MAPPING (won't swap)
**Implications:**
- If patient descriptor: Should add to mapping
- If family term: Correct to exclude (experimental control)

**Recommendation:** Need case-by-case analysis

## Recommendations

### Priority 1: Fix Clear Bugs
1. Add girl/boy/female/male patterns to DiagnosisArena and MedXpertQA
2. Review pronoun threshold (should be >= 2, verify implementation)
3. Add mixed gender detection (both male and female patterns → unclear)

### Priority 2: User Decisions Needed
1. Compound words: Swap or preserve?
2. Daughter/son terms: Family or patient?

### Priority 3: Low-Priority Improvements
1. Malformed boxed syntax handling
2. Empty string returns None
3. Ambiguous answer detection

## Next Steps

1. **User review:** Decide on compound words and daughter/son terms
2. **Fix clear bugs:** Patterns and threshold
3. **Re-run tests:** Validate fixes
4. **Expand coverage:** Add judge and paraphrasing tests (Phase 2)

**Current Status:** Infrastructure ~75% validated, critical paths working, minor bugs found
