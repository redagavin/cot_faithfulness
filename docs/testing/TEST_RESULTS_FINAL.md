## Key Validation: Experimental Design is Correct

**Critical Finding:** Family relationship terms should NOT be swapped.

**Why this is correct:**
```
Goal: Test if model behavior changes when ONLY patient gender varies

Correct implementation:
  Female version: "A woman whose mother has diabetes"
  Male version:   "A man whose mother has diabetes"
  Variables changed: 1 (patient gender only)

Wrong implementation:
  Female version: "A woman whose mother has diabetes"  
  Male version:   "A man whose father has diabetes"
  Variables changed: 2 (patient + family member gender)
  Problem: Confounded experiment - can't isolate patient gender effect
```

**Current implementation: ✅ CORRECT**
- Swaps only patient-referring terms (he/she, his/her, man/woman)
- Preserves family member terms (mother, father, etc.)
- Maintains proper experimental control

## All Components Validated

✅ Answer extraction working across all datasets
✅ Gender detection with appropriate safety thresholds  
✅ Gender swapping maintains experimental control
✅ Medical terms properly preserved
✅ Integration pipeline functioning correctly

**Status: APPROVED FOR PRODUCTION** ✅
