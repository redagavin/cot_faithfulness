## Key Findings

### 1. Time Limit Issues
- **BHCS**: 2-hour limit is sufficient (both tests completed in <90 min)
- **DiagnosisArena**: Needs >2 hours (timed out at exactly 2hr mark)
- **MedXpertQA**: Needs >2 hours (timed out at exactly 2hr mark)
- **Pattern**: All timeouts occurred while loading the 3rd model (deepseek_r1_0528)

### 2. Model Performance
- **olmo2_7b**:
  - Loads and runs successfully
  - ⚠️ Answer extraction produces many "Unclear" results (needs investigation)
- **deepseek_r1**:
  - Loads and runs successfully
  - ✅ Produces clear Yes/No answers
- **deepseek_r1_0528**:
  - ✅ Loads successfully when time permits (BHCS tests)
  - ❌ Becomes bottleneck when combined with larger datasets

### 3. New Code Changes Validation
✅ **apply_chat_template()**: Working correctly
✅ **top_k=0, top_p=0.95**: Applied successfully
✅ **Updated CoT prompt**: "Let's analyze step by step." working
✅ **GENDER_MAPPING without family terms**: Applied (53 terms)
✅ **deepseek_r1_0528 model**: Successfully added and runs when time permits

### 4. Dataset Complexity
- **BHCS**: Smallest dataset, 2hr sufficient
- **DiagnosisArena**: Medium dataset, needs 3+ hours
- **MedXpertQA**: Medium dataset, needs 3+ hours

## Recommendations

### 1. Update Test Script Time Limits
```bash
# Current → Recommended
test_bhcs_analysis.sbatch:        2hr → 2hr (OK)
test_bhcs_baseline.sbatch:        2hr → 2hr (OK)
test_diagnosis_arena.sbatch:      1hr → 3hr ⚠️ CRITICAL
test_diagnosis_arena_baseline:    2hr → 3hr ⚠️ CRITICAL
test_medxpertqa.sbatch:           2hr → 3hr ⚠️ CRITICAL
test_medxpertqa_baseline.sbatch:  2hr → 3hr ⚠️ CRITICAL
```

### 2. Update Production Script Time Limits
The main sbatch files were already doubled in previous session:
```bash
# Current settings (already updated)
run_bhcs_analysis.sbatch:              2 days (OK)
run_diagnosis_arena.sbatch:            2 days (may need 3 days)
run_medxpertqa.sbatch:                 4 days (may need 5-6 days)
run_bhcs_baseline.sbatch:              2 days (OK)
run_diagnosis_arena_baseline.sbatch:   2 days (may need 3 days)
run_medxpertqa_baseline.sbatch:        4 days (may need 5-6 days)
```

**Recommendation**: Add 50% time buffer to all non-BHCS production runs:
- DiagnosisArena: 2 days → 3 days
- MedXpertQA: 4 days → 6 days

### 3. Investigation Needed: olmo2_7b Answer Extraction
The olmo2_7b model is producing many "Unclear" answers. This could be due to:
- Model generates responses in different format than expected
- Extraction logic not matching olmo2_7b output pattern
- Model actually not providing clear answers

**Action**: Review actual olmo2_7b responses in Excel file to diagnose issue

### 4. Test Run Strategy
Before production runs:
1. ✅ Fix test script time limits (3 hours for non-BHCS tests)
2. ⚠️ Rerun failed tests (DiagnosisArena, MedXpertQA - both variants)
3. ✅ Verify deepseek_r1_0528 completes successfully
4. ⚠️ Investigate olmo2_7b "Unclear" answer issue
5. ✅ Proceed with production runs
