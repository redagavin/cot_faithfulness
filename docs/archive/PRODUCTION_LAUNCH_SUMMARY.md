### Test Job (Still Running):
- **Job 2396095**: Test MedXpertQA Baseline (10 samples)
  - Time Limit: 5 hours
  - Partition: frink
  - Status: RUNNING on d3090 (44 minutes elapsed)
  - Purpose: Validate extraction improvements before production

## Code Improvements Applied

All production jobs include the following improvements:

### 1. Special Token Handling
- Added `skip_special_tokens=True` to all tokenizer.decode() calls
- Fixes pattern matching issues with end-of-sequence tokens

### 2. Enhanced Extraction Patterns (BHCS)
- 14 new depression risk patterns for better coverage
- Handles "Choice:", "Conclusion:", and narrative formats
- Expected: 40-90% unclear → 10-30% unclear

### 3. LaTeX Pattern Support (Diagnosis Tasks)
- Added `\boxed{\text{C}}` pattern for deepseek_r1_0528
- Expected: 60-80% unclear → 10-20% unclear for deepseek_r1_0528

## Time Limit Rationale

Based on test results (10 samples):
- BHCS: 30-70 min → 2 days sufficient for full dataset
- DiagnosisArena: 2.5 hrs → 3 days (50% buffer)
- MedXpertQA: 3+ hrs → 6 days (50% buffer for large dataset)

## Monitoring

**Production Monitor**: `monitor_production.sh` (running in background)
- Checks status every 10 minutes
- Logs to `monitor_production.log`
- Shows individual progress for each dataset

**Test Monitor**: Job 2396095 will complete in ~4 hours
- If issues found, production jobs can be cancelled and relaunched
- If successful, validates that improvements are working

## Expected Timeline

### Quick Results (BHCS):
- **Estimated completion**: ~12-24 hours
- Fastest running jobs based on test times
- Will provide first indication of improvement success

### Medium Results (DiagnosisArena):
- **Estimated completion**: 1-2 days
- Moderate dataset size and processing time

### Full Results (MedXpertQA):
- **Estimated completion**: 3-5 days
- Largest dataset and longest processing time
- Final validation of all improvements

## Risk Mitigation

**If test (2396095) shows issues:**
1. Identify problem from test results
2. Apply fix to code
3. Cancel production jobs: `scancel 2396633 2396634 2396635 2396636 2396637 2396638`
4. Relaunch with fixes

**If production jobs fail:**
1. Check error logs: `tail -50 <job_name>_<job_id>.err`
2. Check output logs: `tail -50 <job_name>_<job_id>.out`
3. Apply fixes and relaunch as needed

## Success Criteria

Production runs are successful if:
1. ✅ All jobs complete without timeout or error
2. ✅ Unclear rates < 20% (currently 30-90%)
3. ✅ Extraction patterns capture expected formats
4. ✅ Excel output files generated successfully
5. ✅ Flip rates measurable (low unclear interference)

## Next Steps

1. ⏳ Monitor test job 2396095 completion (~4 hours)
2. ⏳ Check BHCS production results first (~12-24 hours)
3. ⏳ Validate improvements in production data
4. ⏳ Wait for all production jobs to complete
5. ⏳ Analyze final results and summarize findings

## Files to Monitor

**Test Results:**
- `test_medxpertqa_baseline_results.xlsx` (when 2396095 completes)

**Production Results:**
