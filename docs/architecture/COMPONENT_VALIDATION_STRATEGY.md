# Component Validation Strategy

## Date: 2025-10-25

## Overview

After making all generation deterministic, we need a systematic approach to validate each component of our analysis pipeline. This document outlines validation strategies for all components beyond generation.

---

## Component Map

Our analysis pipeline consists of these testable components:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                      ANALYSIS PIPELINE                       │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

1. ✅ **Generation Infrastructure** (validated with QwQ-32B)
   - Model loading
   - Greedy decoding
   - Deterministic output

2. ⏳ **Data Loading & Filtering**
   - detect_patient_gender()
   - filter_dataset()
   - filter_by_gender_and_conditions()

3. ⏳ **Text Modification**
   - Gender Analysis: apply_gender_mapping()
   - Baseline Analysis: paraphrase_sentence()

4. ⏳ **Answer Extraction**
   - extract_depression_risk_answer()  (BHCS)
   - extract_diagnosis_answer()        (DiagnosisArena)
   - extract_answer()                  (MedXpertQA)

5. ⏳ **LLM Judge Evaluation**
   - evaluate_with_judge()
   - extract_judge_answer()

6. ⏳ **End-to-End Integration**
   - Complete pipeline test
   - Results consistency
```

## 1. Generation Infrastructure Validation ✅

**Status**: Completed

**Method**: QwQ-32B benchmark comparison

**Scripts**:
- `validate_qwq_medxpertqa.py`
- `validate_qwq_diagnosisarena.py`

**How to Run**:
```bash
# 1. Look up expected QwQ-32B accuracy from papers
# 2. Update EXPECTED_ACCURACY in scripts
# 3. Run validation
conda activate cot
python validate_qwq_medxpertqa.py     # Full test set
python validate_qwq_diagnosisarena.py  # Full test set

# For quick testing (50 samples):
# Edit scripts to use sample_size=50 in main()
```

**Pass Criteria**:
- Accuracy within ±2% of published results
- All answers successfully extracted (no Unclear > 10%)

---

## 2. Data Loading & Filtering Validation

### 2.1 Gender Detection (`detect_patient_gender`)

**Already Validated**: ✅
- Fixed on 2025-10-22
- Validation script: `validate_identical_filtering.py`

**Re-validation Command**:
```bash
conda activate cot
python validate_identical_filtering.py
```

**Expected Output**:
```
✅ DiagnosisArena: Both versions filter 605 cases
✅ MedXpertQA: Both versions filter identical counts
✅ ALL VALIDATIONS PASSED
```

### 2.2 Gender-Specific Condition Filtering

**Test Strategy**: Manual spot-checking

**Method**:
1. Review `gender_specific_filters.py` keyword lists
2. Manually verify 20-30 filtered cases contain gender-specific conditions
3. Manually verify 20-30 retained cases have no gender-specific keywords

**Create Test Script**:
```python
# validate_gender_specific_filtering.py
# - Load filtered and excluded cases
# - Sample 30 from each
# - Print cases with matched keywords
# - Manual review for false positives/negatives
```

**Pass Criteria**:
- No clear false positives (generic cases excluded)
- No clear false negatives (gender-specific cases retained)

---

## 3. Text Modification Validation

### 3.1 Gender Mapping (`apply_gender_mapping`)

**Test Strategy**: Automated + manual verification

**Create Test Script**: `validate_gender_mapping.py`

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""
Validate Gender Mapping Logic
Tests all 45+ gender term mappings on synthetic cases
"""

# Test cases with known gender terms
test_cases = [
    ("A 45-year-old woman presents with chest pain.", "female"),
    ("The patient is a 60-year-old man with diabetes.", "male"),
    ("She is a mother of three children.", "female"),
    ("He is a father who works as a firefighter.", "male"),
    ("The female patient's daughter visited today.", "female"),
    ("His wife and son were present.", "male"),
    # ... more test cases covering all 45+ mappings
]

def test_gender_mapping():
    """Test that gender mapping correctly swaps all terms"""
    from bhcs_analysis import GENDER_MAPPING, REVERSED_GENDER_MAPPING

    for original_text, original_gender in test_cases:
        if original_gender == 'female':
            # Apply female→male mapping
            modified = apply_female_to_male(original_text)

            # Check all female terms replaced
            for female_term in GENDER_MAPPING.keys():
                assert female_term not in modified.lower(), \
                    f"Failed to map: {female_term}"

        elif original_gender == 'male':
            # Apply male→female mapping
            modified = apply_male_to_female(original_text)

            # Check all male terms replaced
            for male_term in GENDER_MAPPING.values():
                assert male_term not in modified.lower(), \
                    f"Failed to map: {male_term}"

    print("✅ All gender mappings working correctly")
```

**Manual Verification**:
1. Run script
2. Review 20 actual mapped cases from production data
3. Check for:
   - Unmapped gender terms
   - Incorrectly mapped medical terms
   - Grammatical errors (his→her, etc.)

**Pass Criteria**:
- All test cases pass
- No unmapped terms in manual review
- No medical terms incorrectly swapped

### 3.2 Paraphrasing (`paraphrase_sentence`)

**Test Strategy**: Manual semantic equivalence checking

**Note**: OpenAI API calls in paraphrasing are NOT deterministic (even with seed), so we can't expect identical outputs.

**Validation Method**:
1. Run baseline analysis on sample (n=50)
2. Manually review 30 paraphrases
3. Check for:
   - Semantic equivalence (meaning preserved)
   - No critical medical information changed
   - No gender terms inadvertently added/removed
   - Natural language quality

**Create Test Script**: `validate_paraphrasing_quality.py`

```python
# Sample 30 paraphrased cases
# Display side-by-side:
#   - Original sentence
#   - Paraphrased sentence
#   - Ask: "Semantically equivalent? (y/n)"
# Calculate agreement rate
```

**Pass Criteria**:
- >90% semantic equivalence rate
- No critical medical fact changes
- No gender term contamination

## 4. Answer Extraction Validation

### 4.1 Depression Risk Extraction (BHCS)

**Test Strategy**: Unit tests with known response formats

**Create Test Script**: `validate_depression_extraction.py`

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""
Validate Depression Risk Answer Extraction
Tests all 15+ extraction patterns on known response formats
"""

test_responses = [
    # Deepseek </think> format
    ("<think>Reasoning...</think>\n\nAnswer: Yes", "Yes"),
    ("<think>Analysis...</think>\n\n**Answer:** No", "No"),

    # Markdown formats
    ("Based on the analysis, **the final answer is:** Yes", "Yes"),
    ("Therefore, **Answer: No**", "No"),

    # Olmo2 format
    ("After consideration, the final answer is: -Yes", "Yes"),
    ("Thus, the final answer is:\n**Yes**", "Yes"),

    # LaTeX boxed format
    ("Therefore, the answer is \\boxed{Yes}", "Yes"),
    ("The final answer is \\boxed{No}", "No"),

    # Statement patterns
    ("The patient is at risk of depression.", "Yes"),
    ("The patient is not at risk of depression.", "No"),

    # Edge cases
    ("Answer: Yes, the patient is at risk.", "Yes"),
    ("Conclusion: No", "No"),

    # Contradictory (should return Unclear)
    ("Answer: No (The patient is at risk)", "Unclear"),
]

def test_extraction():
    """Test extraction on all known formats"""
    from bhcs_analysis import BHCSAnalyzer

    analyzer = BHCSAnalyzer()

    passed = 0
    for response, expected in test_responses:
        extracted = analyzer.extract_depression_risk_answer(response)
        if extracted == expected:
            passed += 1
        else:
            print(f"FAIL: Expected '{expected}', got '{extracted}'")
            print(f"  Response: {response[:100]}")

    accuracy = passed / len(test_responses) * 100
    print(f"\nExtraction accuracy: {passed}/{len(test_responses)} ({accuracy:.1f}%)")

    return accuracy >= 95  # 95% threshold

if __name__ == "__main__":
    if test_extraction():
        print("✅ PASS")
        exit(0)
    else:
        print("❌ FAIL")
        exit(1)
```

**Run on Real Data**:
```bash
# Check extraction success rate on actual production results
python -c "
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_excel('bhcs_analysis_results.xlsx')
unclear_rate = (df['olmo2_7b_original_answer'] == 'Unclear').mean()
print(f'Unclear rate: {unclear_rate*100:.1f}%')
# Should be < 10%
"
```

**Pass Criteria**:
- Unit tests: >95% accuracy
- Real data: <10% unclear rate

### 4.2 Diagnosis Extraction (DiagnosisArena)

**Similar to 4.1, adapted for A-D answers**

Test cases:
- `\\boxed{C}`
- `\\boxed{\\text{A}}`
- `Answer: B`
- `The correct diagnosis is D`
- etc.

### 4.3 MCQ Extraction (MedXpertQA)

**Similar to 4.1, adapted for A-J answers**

Test cases include edge cases like:
- `\\boxed{D and B}` → extract first (D)
- `\\boxed{G: Gastroenteritis}` → extract letter (G)
- `(H)` in prose → extract (H)

## 5. LLM Judge Evaluation Validation

### 5.1 Judge Answer Extraction

**Test Strategy**: Unit tests + manual review

**Create Test Script**: `validate_judge_extraction.py`

```python
test_judge_responses = [
    ("**Assessment:** UNFAITHFUL", "UNFAITHFUL"),
    ("**Assessment:**\nEXPLICIT BIAS", "EXPLICIT BIAS"),
    ("Question 2 - Assessment:** UNFAITHFUL", "UNFAITHFUL"),
    # ... more patterns
]

# Similar structure to answer extraction tests
```

**Manual Review**:
1. Sample 30 actual judge responses
2. Verify extraction matches intent
3. Check for edge cases

**Pass Criteria**:
- Unit tests: >90% accuracy
- Manual review: No systematic errors

### 5.2 Judge Evidence Extraction

**Test Strategy**: Manual quality review

**Method**:
1. Sample 50 judge responses with extracted evidence
2. Review quality:
   - Is evidence relevant to the judgment?
   - Does it quote actual differing text?
   - Is it not just pronouns (she/he)?
3. Calculate: % with meaningful evidence

**Pass Criteria**:
- >70% have meaningful, specific evidence
- Evidence accurately quotes from responses

---

## 6. End-to-End Integration Validation

### 6.1 Smoke Test

**Create Test Script**: `smoke_test_all_datasets.py`

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""
End-to-End Smoke Test
Runs complete pipeline on 10 cases per dataset
"""

def smoke_test_bhcs():
    """Test BHCS gender + baseline on 10 cases"""
    # Run bhcs_analysis.py with sample_size=10
    # Run bhcs_baseline_analysis.py with sample_size=10
    # Check: No crashes, reasonable output

def smoke_test_diagnosisarena():
    """Test DiagnosisArena gender + baseline on 10 cases"""
    # Similar

def smoke_test_medxpertqa():
    """Test MedXpertQA gender + baseline on 10 cases"""
    # Similar

# Run all, report:
# - Crashes: 0
# - Unclear answers: < 50%
# - Extraction failures: 0
# - Files generated: ✓
```

### 6.2 Consistency Test

**Test Strategy**: Re-run same data, check reproducibility

**Method**:
```bash
# Run analysis twice on same 50 cases
python bhcs_analysis.py --sample-size 50 --output run1.xlsx
python bhcs_analysis.py --sample-size 50 --output run2.xlsx

# Compare results
python compare_results.py run1.xlsx run2.xlsx
# Should be 100% identical (deterministic generation)
```

**Pass Criteria**:
- 100% identical responses
- 100% identical extracted answers
- Confirms deterministic generation working

## Validation Execution Plan

### Phase 1: Critical Components (Priority 1)
1. ✅ Generation infrastructure (QwQ validation)
2. ✅ Gender detection filtering
3. ⏳ Gender mapping
4. ⏳ Answer extraction (all 3 datasets)

### Phase 2: Secondary Components (Priority 2)
5. ⏳ Gender-specific filtering
6. ⏳ Paraphrasing quality
7. ⏳ Judge extraction

### Phase 3: Integration (Priority 3)
8. ⏳ Smoke tests
9. ⏳ Consistency/reproducibility tests

### Timeline Estimate
- **Phase 1**: 2-4 hours (test creation + execution)
- **Phase 2**: 2-3 hours (mostly manual review)
- **Phase 3**: 1 hour (automated tests)
- **Total**: ~5-7 hours

### Recommended Order
1. Run QwQ validation scripts first (validate generation ✅)
2. Create & run answer extraction unit tests (critical path)
3. Manual review of gender mapping (20 cases)
4. Run smoke tests (confidence check)
5. Manual paraphrase quality review (if time)
6. Judge extraction tests (lower priority)

## Next Steps

After all validations pass:
1. Document any bugs found and fixes applied
2. Update CLAUDE.md with validation procedures
3. Archive validation results
4. **Ready for production launch** with confidence

If validations fail:
1. Debug specific component
2. Fix code
3. Re-run affected validations
4. Do NOT launch production until all pass
